## üõ† Features

### Open-Source and Self-Hosted

RabbitMQ is a widely used open-source message broker, and Rabbitory is a natural extension of that philosophy. As an open-source management tool, the Rabbitory Control Panel runs on an EC2 instance in your own AWS environment, giving you a fully transparent and self-hosted way to manage your infrastructure.

### One-Click RabbitMQ Provisioning

Spin up production-ready RabbitMQ instances on AWS in just a few clicks. Rabbitory handles the underlying EC2 provisioning, security group setup, and instance initialization, so you can go from zero to running in minutes‚Äîno manual setup required.

### RabbitMQ-as-a-Service

Once your new instance is ready, the Control Panel gives you a complete set of tools to manage it. You can change RabbitMQ configurations, enable plugins, upgrade your EC2 hardware and storage, manage firewall rules, and montior performance with logs and alarms.Rabbitory gives you full visibility into your setup so you can monitor your message queues and keep your system running smoothly.

### Smart UI Notifications

The Control Panel keeps you informed with real-time alers for all instance operations. Whether an update is pending, in progress, successful, or has failed, you‚Äôll see immediate feedback right in the UI. This helps you stay aware of what‚Äôs happening in your messaging infrastructure ‚Äî so you're never left guessing.

### Flexible Instance Sizing

Choose the instance type and storage size that best fits your workload. Whether you‚Äôre testing a small service or running production traffic, Rabbitory gives you the flexibility to scale on your terms.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Before gaining access to your Rabbitory Control Panel, you'll need to use the Rabbitory CLI to deploy your AWS infrastructure. Please visit the [Rabbitory CLI github repository](https://github.com/Rabbitory/rabbitory_cli) for information and instructions.

## üê∞ Usage

The Rabbitory Control Panel is your central hub for managing every part of your RabbitMQ instance ‚Äî from creation to configuration to monitoring.

### Create a RabbitMQ Instance

Start with the New Instance Form, which walks you through provisioning a RabbitMQ server on AWS with just a few inputs.

### View All Your Instances

Once launched, your instance appears on the Home Page, where you can view all your running instances at a glance, along with their real-time status. Additionally, if you no longer need an instance, you can easily terminate it directly from the same page with just a few clicks.

### View Details for a RabbitMQ Instance

Each instance has a General Page that gives you everything you need to start sending and receiving messages ‚Äî including your RabbitMQ endpoint, credentials, and key metadata.

Notably, this page provides you with your instance's RabbitMQ connection URL. This URL contains your username, password, server address, and virtual host, and it's what your producer and consumer applications use to connect to your RabbitMQ instance to send and receive messages.

This page additionally provides a link to the RabbitMQ Management UI, which is the built-in web interface provided by RabbitMQ.
