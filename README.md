## üõ† Features

### Open-Source and Self-Hosted

Rabbitory gives you full control over your messaging infrastructure. Both the control panel and CLI are fully open-source, allowing you to inspect, modify, and run everything on your own terms ‚Äî no black boxes, no vendor lock-in. Unlike traditional platforms that hide infrastructure details, Rabbitory helps you manage your resources directly. That means complete visibility, total control, and the freedom to scale or secure your setup however you see fit.

### Simplified Provisioning, Configuration, and Monitoring

Spin up RabbitMQ instances on AWS with just a few clicks. Configure plugins, update settings, and monitor instance details through an intuitive UI designed to streamline even the trickiest parts of RabbitMQ management.

### Smart Notifications

Stay in the loop with real-time alerts. The control panel notifies you when updates to your instance are pending, in progress, or complete ‚Äî so you're never left guessing.

### Flexible Instance Sizing

Choose the instance type and storage size that best fits your workload. Whether you‚Äôre testing a small service or running production traffic, Rabbitory gives you the flexibility to scale on your terms.

### View Details for a RabbitMQ Instance

Each instance has a General Page that gives you everything you need to start sending and receiving messages ‚Äî including your RabbitMQ endpoint, credentials, and key metadata.

Notably, this page provides you with your instance's RabbitMQ connection URL. This URL contains your username, password, server address, and virtual host, and it's what your producer and consumer applications use to connect to your RabbitMQ instance to send and receive messages.

This page additionally provides a link to the RabbitMQ Management UI, which is the built-in web interface provided by RabbitMQ.
